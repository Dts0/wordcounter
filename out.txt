sheet    who's really addicting you to technology  a  nearly everyone i know is addicted in some measure to the internet   wrote tony schwartz in the new york times  it's a common complaint these days  a steady stream of similar headlines accuse the net and its offspring apps  social media sites and online games of addicting us to distraction b  there's little doubt that nearly everyone who comes in contact with the net has difficulty concentration than it takes to post a status update  as one person ironically put it in the comments section of schwartz's online article   as i was reading this very excellent article i stopped at least half a dozen times to cheek my email  c there's something different about this technology  it is both invasive and persuasive  but who's at fault for its overuse    to find solutions  it's important to understand what we   re dealing with there are four parties conspiring to keep you connected the tech  your boss  your friends and you  d the technologies themselves and their makers  are the easiest suspects to blame for our diminishing attention spans  nicholas carr author of the shallows    what the internet is doing our brains  wrote  the net is designed to be an interruption system  a machine geared to dividing attention  e online services like facebook  twitter and the like  are called out of manipula tion  making   products so good that people can't stop using them  after studying these products for several years  i wrote a book about how they do it  i learned it all starts with the business model  since these services rely on advertising revenue  the more frequently you use money they make it   s no winder these companies employ teams of people focused on engineering their services to be as engaging as possible  these products aren't habit forming by chance  it's by design  they have an incentive to keep us hooked  f however  as good as these services are  there are simple steps we can take to keep them at bay for example  we can change how often we receive the distracting notifications that trigger our urge to check according to adam marchick  ceo of mobile marketing company kahuna  less than    percent of smartphone users ever bother to adjust their notification setlings  meaning the remaining    percent of us default to the app makers' every preset trigger google and apple have made it far too difficult to adjust these settings so it's up to us to take steps ensure we set these triggers to suit our own needs  not the needs of the app makers  g while companies like facebook harvest attention to generate revenue from advertisers  other technologies have no such agenda  take email  for example  this system couldn't care less how often you use it  yet to many  email is the most habit forming medium of all we check email at all hours of the day  we're obsessed  but why  because that's what the boss wants for almost all white collar jobs  a slow response to a message could hurt not only your reputation but also your livelihood  h your friends are also responsible think about this familiar scene people gathered around a table  enjoying food and each others company  there's laughter and a bit of kidding  then  during an interval in the conversation  someone takes out their phone to check who knows what barely anyone notices and no one says a thing  i now imagine the same dinner but instead of checking their phone  the person belches           loudly everyone notices  unless the meal takes place in a beer house  this is considered bad manners  the impolite act violates the basic rules of etiquette  one has to wonder why don   t we apply the same social norms to checking phones during meals  meetings and conversations as we do to other antisocial behaviors somehow  we accept it and say nothing when someone offends  j the reality is taking one's phone out at the wrong time is worse than belching because  unlike other minor offense  checking tech is contagious  once one person looks at their phone other people feel compelled to do the same  starting a chain reaction  the more people are on their phones  the fewer people are talking until finally you are the only one left not reading email or checking twitter  from a societal perspective  phone checking is less like belching in public and more like another bad habit  our phones are like cigarettes something to do when were bored or when our fingers need something to toy with seeing others enjoy a smoke or sneak a quick glance  is too tempting to resist and soon everyone is doing it  k the technology  your boss  and your friends  all influence how often you find yourself using  or overusing  these gadgets  but there's still someone who deserves scrutiny  the person holding the phone  l  i have a confession  even though i study habit forming technology for a living  disconnecting is not easy for me i'm online far more than i'd like like schwartz and so many others  i often find myself distracted and off tack i wanted to know why so i began self monitoring to try to understand my behavior  that's when i discovered an uncomfortable truth  i use technology as an escape  when i'm doing something i'd rather not do  or when i'm someplace i'd rather not attention was often a good thing  like when passing time on public transportation  but frequently my tech use was not so benign  when i faced difficult work  like thinking through an article idea or editing the same draft for the hundredth time  for example  a more sinister screen would draw me in  i could easily escape discomfort temporarlly by answering email or browsing ing the web under the pretense of so called research   though i desperately wanted to lay blame elsewhere  i finally had to admit that my bad habits had less to do with new age technology and more to do with old fashioned procrastination           m it's easy to blame technology for being so distracting  but distraction is nothing new  aristotle and socrates dehated nature of    akrasia     our tendency to do things agninst our interests  if we're honest with ourselves  tech is just another way to occupy our time and minds if we weren   t on our devices  we   d likely do similarly unproductive  n personal technology is indeed more engaging than ever  and there's no doubt companies are engineering their products and services to be more compelling and attractive but would want it any other way the intended result of making something better is that people use it more  that's not necessarily a problem  that's progress  o these improvements don't mean we shouldn't attempt to control our use of technology  in order to make sure it doesn't control us  we should come to terms with the fact that it's more than the technology itself that   s responsible for our habits  our workplace culture  social norns and individual behaviors all play a part to put technology in its place  we must be conscious not only of how technology is changing  but also of how it is changing us     online services are so designed that the more they are used  the more profit they generate      the author admits using technology as an escape from the task at hand      checking phones at dinners is now accepted as normal but not belching     to make proper use of technology  we should not only increase our awareness of how it is changing but also how it is impacting us      most of us find it hard to focus on our immediate tasks because of internet distractions     when one person starts checking their phone  the others will follow suit     the great majority of smartphone users don' t take the trouble to adjust their settings to suit their own purposes     the internet is regarded by some as designed to distract our attention      the author attributes his tech addiction chiefly to his habit of putting off doing what he should    white collar workers check email round the clock because it is required by their employers
